\begin{Description}\relax
\code{Cairo.capabilities} returns a logical vector describing the
capabilities of this particular Cairo build.
\end{Description}
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
Cairo.capabilities()
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
\begin{Details}\relax
The \code{Cairo} package provides multiple back-ends, such as images
(PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector graphics (PDF, PostScript, SVG) or displays
(X11, Windows). However, not all systems support all back-ends. The
\code{Cairo.capabilities} function returns a logical vector showing
which capabilities are supported in this particular Cairo build.

Note that the capabilities depend both on the libraries available in
the system as well as the compiled-in modules in cairo graphics.
