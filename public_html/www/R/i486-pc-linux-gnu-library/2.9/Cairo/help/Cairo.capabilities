     The 'Cairo' package provides multiple back-ends, such as images
     (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector graphics (PDF, PostScript, SVG) or
     displays (X11, Windows). However, not all systems support all
     back-ends. The 'Cairo.capabilities' function returns a logical
     vector showing which capabilities are supported in this particular
     Cairo build.

     Note that the capabilities depend both on the libraries available
     in the system as well as the compiled-in modules in cairo
     graphics.
